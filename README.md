# Week 1 - Activity Checklist #1

##OBJECTIVE
To provide you with a tool to track your progress in completing required activities throughout the semester.

##WHAT YOU'RE GOING TO DO:
- Every time you do activity work (i.e. Google CodeLabs) for this class:
- Open up your Activity Checklist.
- Record the time you start the activity.
- Write down any questions you have along the way.
- Record the time you finish the activity.
- Fill in other cells as appropriate.

## SUGGESTIONS AND STRATEGIES:
> Do this every time you do assigned work - it's going to be waaaay easier keeping up that way.
> Be honest! Filling this out honestly will give you a meaningful record for your self-evaluation.
> If you ever have unanswered questions left over after finishing an activity, or a unit, post them on Slack so that we can discuss about it in the following class - there is a good chance someone has found an answer, or would be willing to help you find it.

## SUBMISSION GUIDELINES:
- Use the following GitHub Classroom repo to write your code and push it in the repository: [Link](https://classroom.github.com/a/gRePZcZB)
- In the GitHub README.md file, write down what you have learned in this week and write down the accomplishments and some challenges that you faced in the process of doing the weekly activity. If you don't know how to write in markdown language in GitHub, please refer to this [link](https://docs.github.com/en/get-started/writing-on-github/getting-started-with-writing-and-formatting-on-github/basic-writing-and-formatting-syntax).  
- Use the following template as an example to create your own first activity checklist: [Activity Checklist Template](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1jTBIJfgDkYe-HZrR8PKGQ__ljNAOs3v73gf003IY3y0/edit?usp=sharing)
- You need to upload this template as an excel or PDF by filling out with your information in the Brightspace assignment submission.
